# Print profiles for the MakerGear printers.

# NOTE(ibash) this is based on the profiles from here: http://forum.makergear.com/viewtopic.php?t=7273
# Which in turn is based on the Simplify3D profiles supplied by makergear.
#
# This file was created by splitting the profiles from the forum into different files running comm/diff on the splits.
#
# The trick is to create common profiles for single extrusion, dual extrusion, and duplication individually and then nozzle sizes individually.
#
# for example, to produce a common profile:
#
#   ```
#   comm -12 profile_1.ini profile_2.ini | \
#   comm -12 - 3.ini | \
#   comm -12 - 4.ini | > common_profile.ini
#   ```
#
# and to produce a diff profile:
#
#   ```
#   diff  --suppress-common-lines profile_1.ini comm.ini | grep \<
#   ```
